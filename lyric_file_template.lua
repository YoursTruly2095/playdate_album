This file shows the general pattern for a lyric file.

It's just a table of strings...

The spacing around the title will mean the title is 
shown centrally when entering lyric mode.

The spacing between verses just seems to work for me, 
but you can have any or none.

The loading code will split lines that are too wide 
to fit on the screen into two and display them nicely,
but only up to double the screen width. If the line is 
longer than that you should break it up in this file.
